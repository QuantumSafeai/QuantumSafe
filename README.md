# 🛡️ QuantumSafe — Defending Web3 from Quantum Threats

QuantumSafe is the first open platform to detect, assess, and secure digital assets and Web3 projects from the rising threat of quantum computing.

> 5000 $SOL have been allocated to reward the community for helping secure the post-quantum future.

## 🚀 What is QuantumSafe?

QuantumSafe is an AI-driven platform designed to audit and reinforce the cryptographic foundations of decentralized assets across multiple blockchains.  
It helps projects identify risks, calculate post-quantum resilience, and guide them through secure upgrades.
